**TipZ** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Zeyi Hong Chen**

Time spent: **48** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [x] Settings icon would popover a split option for the user, when he/she is dining with others.
- [x] Created a logo that would clear user input and all data based on input.
- [x] Added a custom tip percentage field for user to enter if user wants to tip a different amount.
- [x] Added a custom dollar tip field for user to enter based on the quantity of tip the user feels to give.
- [x] Added a slider that calculates how many people the user is with, and it calculates equally amount each person needs to pay.
- [x] Added some cool coloring to the app.

## Notes

  Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
  
    A challenge I encountered was working with UINavigationBar. I tried adding multiple items to the UIBarButtonItem
    but when adding more than three things, it would only display two items and the rest of items vanishes.
    Also, while building the app, my computer simulator only works with iPhone 5S. From iPhone 6 and above, 
    the simulator would just crash. Therefore, the layout of labels may not be fixed for thoese devices.
